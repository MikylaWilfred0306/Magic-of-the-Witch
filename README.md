# Magic-of-the-Witch
This is a rpg unity game. 
The project was for my capstone in my senior year of college. The presentation is the uploaded pdf.

## The Story
The main character, Isabelle, lives in a small medieval land, Ashwood. While Isabella is playing hide and seek with her siblings, Alice, Leo, and Cassius, they get kidnapped. Isabelle goes through a portal that takes them to a similar world as the first but the color scheme changes, making it the witch world which is referred to as Dragon Ash. Isabelle must save her three siblings who have been sold to three random witches in Dragon Ash by the evil head witch.

## Starting the Game
On the load, it starts with a song and a moving background with the directions on how to play.

Then on start the game, there is an opening cut scene with a voice over. 

## Gameplay
This game character can toggle from first to third person.
There are teleports that take you to the witches lairs to save your siblings.
There is a health bar that will give you a game over screen if you lose. Enemies can move and attack you. They are very simple but effective.
